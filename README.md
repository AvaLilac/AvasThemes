This repository serves as a way to edit and fix my themes for the people who use them. the css part is the themes code. the ones out of the css folder are the ones you can put into your installation of vesktop/equibop
which will import the css code from the css folder. this makes it easy for me to update for everyone when i have a fix

I would use the file outside of the folder. do not use a online file as that is impossible to change code to fit you
